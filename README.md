# react-native-webview-postmessage
Minimal viable example of a working postMessage scenario with React Native WebView

The problem seems to be a timing issue really. I shit you not. It's so fucking unsatisfying, but it's the truth. Also tried window.onload and all the good shit. Didn't work.

If you stumble upon this while doing some research on the topic, good luck. This is ugly as hell, but should work as a callback mechanism.

If you know some better way or want to improve it, go on and PR.
